    "***Favorable label:*** A label whose value corresponds to an outcome that provides an advantage to the recipient (such as receiving a loan, being hired for a job, not being arrested)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Protected attribute:*** An attribute that partitions a population into groups whose outcomes should have parity (such as race, gender, caste, and religion)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Privileged value (of a protected attribute):*** A protected attribute value indicating a group that has historically been at a systemic advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "***Fairness metric:*** A quantification of unwanted bias in training data or models\n",
    "\n",
    "***Discrimination/unwanted bias:*** Although bias can refer to any form of preference, fair or unfair, our focus is on undesirable bias or discrimination, which is when specific privileged groups are placed at a systematic advantage and specific unprivileged groups are placed at a systematic disadvantage. This relates to attributes such as race, gender, age, and sexual orientation."

If the application follows the WYSIWYG worldview, then the equality of odds metrics should be used: average_odds_difference and average_abs_odds_difference.  Other group fairness metrics (some are often labeled equality of opportunity) lie in-between the two worldviews and may be used appropriately: false_negative_rate_ratio, false_negative_rate_difference, false_positive_rate_ratio, false_positive_rate_difference, false_discovery_rate_ratio, false_discovery_rate_difference, false_omission_rate_ratio, false_omission_rate_difference, error_rate_ratio, and error_rate_difference.
