# Non-Discrimination in Deep Learning: An Application to trustworthy Cardiac Disease Diagnosis

This repository is the majority of my thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Fundamental Principles of Data Science from the University of Barcelona

## About the Project

The aim of this project is to investigate and develop a fairness framework to mitigate bias by deep learning models in the multi-classification of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This model identifies three protected groups, race, sex, and age, to evaluate fairness in the diagnosis of the followings CVDs:

  1. Cardiomyopathies (control)
  2. Myocardial Infarction
  3. Ischemic Heart Disease
  4. Heart Failure
  5. Hypertension
  6. Peripheral Vascular Disease
  7. Cardiac Arrest
  8. Cerebral Infarction
  9. Arrhythmia
